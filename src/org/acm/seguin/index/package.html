Experiment with using the advanced features of the file
selection dialog box provided by swing.  I was inspired
by an article in the <EM>Java Developer's Journal</EM> to
create a better dialog box.  This particular experiment
creates a dialog box that loads GIF and JPG images and
displays them in the file selection dialog box.<P>
This was just for fun.
