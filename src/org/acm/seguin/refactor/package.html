Responsible for storing the software that performs the
refactorings.  This package contains the base classes
for the refactorings.  It also has a number of classes
that are used by several types of refactorings.  This
page briefly describes these types, then moves on to
describe how to create a new refactoring.<P>

<UL>
<LI>  <B>Refactoring</B> is the base class for refactoring.
<LI>  <B>TransformAST</B> is the base class for making a
transformation on a syntax tree.
<LI>  <B>ComplexTransform</B> combines a number of
TransformASTs together to update a single file.
<LI>  <B>RefactoringException</B> is thrown when the
requested refactoring cannot be performed.
<LI>  <B>AddImportTransform</B> is a TransformAST that
adds an import statement to the file
<LI>  <B>RemoveImportTransform</B> is a TransformAST that
removes an import statement from a file
</UL>

<H2>How to create a new refactoring</H2>

<P>This portion of the document describes how to create
a new refactoring, or at least the methodology that was
used to create the existing refactorings.</P>

<P>The first step is to create a set of source files to test on.
This file contains the "clean" version of the file before
the refactoring was applied.  Then I hand edited the file
so that it was the correct result.  Then applied the pretty
printer to the edited file.  (If more than one file is updated
by a refactoring, this process is repeated for each file.)</P>

<P>The second step is to create a unit test.  To do this,
I extended org.acm.seguin.junit.DirSourceTestCase.  This
takes all the features of the TestCase from junit and adds
in the specific directories.  Root is the working directory,
clean contains the unmodified files, and check contains the
correct files.  The unit test:</P>

<OL>
<LI> Copies the files from the
clean directory to the working directory
<LI> Applies the
refactoring
<LI> Compares the file in the working directory
to the correct file
<LI> Deletes the file in the working directory
</OL>

<P>To get the unit test to compile, I create a refactoring
class.  I call the refactoring class XXXRefactoring, and
it extends org.acm.seguin.refactor.Refactoring.  The refactoring
goes into the appropriate package.  At the moment, the
kinds of refactoring are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>  <B>org.acm.seguin.refactor.type</B> - renaming and moving classes, adding child
or parent classes, removing classes
<LI>  <B>org.acm.seguin.refactor.field</B> - renaming and moving fields
<LI>  <B>org.acm.seguin.refactor.method</B> - renaming and moving methods
</UL>

<P>I quickly create the empty methods so that the refactoring
is not abstract, and then everything should compile.  I compile,
and run the unit tests to see that the junit test fails because
the files do not match.  (Other types of failures are caused
by the unit test being incorrect - so now that is debugged.)</P>

<P>Next I create a number of TransformASTs that perform some
unit transformation on the parse tree.  I've used these to
add or remove a node in the parse tree or replace a name
everywhere it occurs in the source tree.</P>

<P>Sometimes a TransformAST hands it's work off to a
Visitor object.  The org.acm.seguin.parser.ChildrenVisitor
is a good one to choose as a base class for this visitor.
It already provides the ability to traverse the entire tree.
Then all I have to do is overload the specific visit
methods for the nodes I'm concerned about.</P>

<P>To learn more about what exactly the source tree looks like,
look at the java1_1.jjt file that is included in the code.jar
file.</P>

<P>Now we have a bunch of TransformAST objects which
might call visitors to do their work.  How do these
get combined together to update a single file?
I would then create a ComplexTransform
and add to it each TransformAST object that is necessary to
update that file.  Create an instance of the ComplexTransform
with the getComplexTransform() method of the Refactoring
object.  (This is done to support undoing the refactoring.)</P>

<P>If the effect of a refactoring requires that
perhaps a large number of files be modified, then I use
a SummaryVisitor to traverse all the source files that
are loaded into memory.  A good visitor to extend is
the org.acm.seguin.summary.TraversalVisitor.  It
traverses the summary file.</P>

<P>To learn more about the Summary objects, look
at the org.acm.seguin.summary package.  The Summary
objects store the metadata for all the source
files that are loaded.  One thing to note about
the FileSummary objects is that if they have a
file that is equal to null, then the FileSummary
and associated types are from the JDK or a 3rd party
library.  These types cannot be updated by the
refactoring tool.</P>

<P>By this point we have a Refactoring object.
It applies a ComplexTransform to a single file
or uses a TraversalVisitor to apply the ComplexTransform
to a series of files.  The ComplexTransform applies
a number of TransformAST objects to update a single
parse tree.</P>

<P>Once the unit test passes, you are done!</P>
