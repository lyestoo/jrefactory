<BODY>
Contains the type refactorings.  The refactorings in this
package are type based refactorings, for instance move
a class to a different package or rename a class.<P>

This package also contains a number of different visitors
that traverse the entire tree of source files, since
type based operations have the possibility of changing
all the source files in the system.<P>

Beneath that are TransformAST objects which perform a
single unit operation such as renaming a type.  The
actual work isusually done by the associated visitor
object.<P>
